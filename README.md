## Reflection

This project was a lot of work that spanned all I knew about frontend development and data collection. I learned how to use some basic html, css, and js to create a website to display move data for Guilty Gear Strive characters (as of 10-19-21). This pursuit had the aim of recreating what mspkvp did with their Tekken 7 pretty move list. In addition, I learned about webscraping after having only a little experience with it prior. I had the opportunity to scrap a page of it's contents and created data structures to capture what I needed so I could produce a json file formatted in a manner that was easy for my frontend to accept. With this data, my frontend js was able to generate html elements accordingly. My css experience prior was lackluster at best but through this project I learned to really internalize the box model, take advantage of the "cascading" part of css, and explore new additions to what I learned prior, such as variables and playing around with the scrollbar.

In one aspect, this project was too much time and effort and more projects could have been made in the same time. In another, I'm proud to have created this project at all and achieve the goals I set out for it. There is so much more to learn and many ways this project could have gone better by implementing something like a deadline. But all in all, I hope you found this helpful and I hope to hear from you and your own project. Thanks!
